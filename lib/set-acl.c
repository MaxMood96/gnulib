/* Set the access control lists of a file to match *exactly* MODE (this might
   remove inherited ACLs). Note chmod() tends to honor inherited/default
   ACLs. If DESC is a valid file descriptor, use file descriptor operations
   where available, else use filename based operations on NAME.  If access
   control lists are not available, fchmod the target file to MODE.  Also
   sets the non-permission bits of the destination file
   (S_ISUID, S_ISGID, S_ISVTX) to those from MODE if any are set.
    Return 0 if successful.  On failure, output a diagnostic, set errno and
    return -1.  */
